# CryptoTracker
+ Goal is to create simple app to allow users keep track of historical data of cryptocurrency prices
+ All data pulled from [coinmarketcap API] (https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)

# TODO
+ Improve general design, colors of app, currently very bare-bones
+ Improve graph, as of now not really that helpful (something similar to apple stocks or robinhood graphs?)
+ Add more relevant info from API
