# CryptoTracker
+ Goal is to create simple app to allow users keep track of historical data of cryptocurrency prices

# TODO
+ Improve general design, colors of app, currently very bare-bones
+ Improve graph, as of now not really that helpful (something similar to apple stocks or robinhood graphs?)
